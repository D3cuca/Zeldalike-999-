# Zeldalike

 First prototype for the zeldalike project
 
   3 years ago, I had and idea for an RPG game with mechanics that would focus on defending and finding creative ways to resolve battles and empathize with mobs and monsters.
   All of this in order to have an interactive experience that hopefully would never leave the player, even after putting the controller down. 
   I've been learning Game/Level design technics and about the game developpment world in general in order to use the skills I've learned throughout my psychology bachelors and  
   make that dream game come alive.
  
This is one of the first saved prototype projects and I've been developping it ever since that idea struck. Everyday I learn something new and there have been some changes but the goal will always be the same.
